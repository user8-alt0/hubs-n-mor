This repository contains a library of personal offsec scripts and executables. 

### I do highly recommend you do not download these. Some of them do contain malicious code and should not be executed on any other device other than the one i am legally allowed to pentest. Thank you for your understanding!

This repository was created because i personally needed a simpler way to study with and experiment the usage of diverse types of malware/ viruses and every different kind of software related to offecsive cybersecurity.
Therefore it contains scripts and binaries that exist solely for my personal use and education.
I find that having them all stored away on a repository and having them accessable the way i made them be helps with portability.
